An unfinished project for a client who was building an app for prospective students to search for Uni Course that led to particular careers.

Built using Angular and Bootstrap. Includes a very small Angular API to integrate to a MySQL database.

A demo can be found here: http://unicedemo.stickypixel.com/?#/K1902

This really a demo of the Angular work rather than the my front-end development! ;-)

You just need to enter a Rome Code and the site will display some graphs containing statistics about students who attend the University of Nice who are now in that career.

A list of Rome Codes can be found here: http://emploi.spf75.org/Codes-ROME-des-Metiers.html?lang=fr

Note that not all Rome codes are represented by people who attend UNice.
