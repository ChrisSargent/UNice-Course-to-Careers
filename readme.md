An unfinished project (and hence VERY rough around the edges) for a client who was building an app for prospective students to search for Uni Course that led to particular careers.

Built using Angular and Bootstrap. Includes a very small Angular API to integrate to a MySQL database.

A demo can be found here: http://unicedemo.stickypixel.com

This really a demo of the Angular work rather than the my front-end development! ;-)

You can search for a career, such as 'Avocat' and the app will spit out a list of former Student's current job titles, with their corresponding CodeROME and Diploma Specialty. There is also a charts tab which, when you click on a table row, will display some graphs containing statistics about students who attended the University of Nice who are now in that career.

A list of Rome Codes can be found here: http://emploi.spf75.org/Codes-ROME-des-Metiers.html?lang=fr
